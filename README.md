# Sentilyser

Sentilyser, is built on python. Using feature extraction modules, features like frequency, pitch, speech rate etc are exploited and these features are fed to a Support Vector Machine and the values of valence and arousal are calculated. These values are then used to find the corresponding emotions using a k-nn classifier.
